# A Kernel Seedling

In this lab, we have designed a kernel module that accesses the system's process table in order to generate a `/proc/count` file containing the total number of processes running on the machine.

## Building

Build the module in the root directory using the Makefile:
```bash
make
```

## Running

Insert the module into the kernel using `sudo` permissions:
```bash
sudo isnmod proc_count.ko
```

Generate the output of the `/proc/count` file:
```bash
cat /proc/count
```

To sanity check this value, compare it to the value output by:
```bash
ps -e | wc -l
```

The value output by the `cat` command should be the number of processes
currently running on the machine. The value output by the following command
should be 2 higher than the number generated by `cat`, as it is also the number
of processes running on the machine, with the `ps` and `wc` processes added on.

## Cleaning Up

Remove the kernel module using `sudo` permissions:
```bash
sudo rmmod proc_count.ko
```

Clean up your filesystem:
```bash
make clean
```

## Testing

Testing was performed on kernel version `5.11.9-arch1-1` (found using `uname -r`), with release information of `#1 SMP PREEMPT Wed, 24 Mar 2021 18:53:34 +0000` (found using `uname -v`)
