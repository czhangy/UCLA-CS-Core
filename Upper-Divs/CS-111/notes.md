## Lecture 1: Expectations and Overview

- An OS sits between applications and hardware
  - The primary role of an OS is to manage and coordinate resources
- Ubuntu and Android are considered different OSes
  - Both use a Linux kernel, but they run different applications
  - There isn't a clear line, especially with Linux
  - For desktop applications (using a GUI), you'd draw the line at the Display System
  - Linux uses Wayland, and Android uses SurfaceFlinger
- OSes allow running more than 1 application
  - Without an OS, a CPU start executing code at a fixed address
  - You could put your application here, but it would be the only one
  - You would have to handle specific hardware in your application
  - Instead, we start executing an OS at boot
- Our first abstraction is a process
  - Each process contains its own set of registers, including the program counter
  - When starting a process, it specifies where the CPU should start executing
  - The OS has to:
    - Keep track of registers for each process
    - Switch between different processes
    - Decide when to switch between processes
- We could put applications in different parts of memory
  - This isn't very flexible
- Virtualization fools something into thinking it has all resources in a system
- Virtual memory abstracts away physical memory
  - Each process believes it has access to all the memory
  - Different processes can have the same starting address
  - The OS has to:
    - Map VM access to PM
    - Keep track of memory usage (allocate and deallocate)
    - Handle out-of-memory scenarios
      - Swap file
      - Out-of-memory killer
- Virtualization is a powerful concept
  - Applies to both processes and VM
  - We can extend this to an entire machine
  - A single PM can run multiple OSes at once
- Concurrency is multiple things happening at the same time
  - We want multiple applications running at once
    - The application is binary, purely static
    - A process is the application while its running
  - We want applications to do multiple things at once
  - We don't want applications isolated
  - We want applications and libraries to communicate
    - Otherwise, the application is useless
- Concurrency is necessary for OSes
  - Running 1 application at a time isn't a good experience
  - Completely isolate applications aren't useful
    - The simplest applications still communicate with the terminal
  - The OS has to:
    - Allow multiple executions at once, safely
      - One application shouldn't be able to impact another, unless intended
    - Manage abstractions for different kinds of inter-process communication (IPC)
    - Provide permission checking and access control
- Finally, we need persistence for a basic OS
  - We want to be able to access data between boots
  - A file system specifies how to organize data on a storage medium
  - The OS has to:
    - Store and retrieve data
    - Ensure integrity of data
- File descriptors abstract both communication and persistence
  - A file descriptor is just a number identifier (per process) that you can:
    - Read bytes from
    - Write bytes to
  - The OS can direct the bytes to whatever it represents
  - You could imagine it representing a file, or one side of communication
- Security is another consideration
  - We want our computers to only do what we tell them to
  - The OS has to:
    - Encrypt sensitive data
    - Prevent bypassing access control
    - Only execute applications the user wants
- Most kernel code is device drivers
  - Device drivers implement the abstractions we'll learn to the physical hardware
  - It involves reading manufacturer specifications and finding bugs
  - Sometimes there's inconsistencies between documentation and reality
- There are 4 major concepts in this course:
  - Virtualization
  - Concurrency
  - Persistence
  - Security



## Lecture 2: Interfaces

- CPUs have "rings" to control instruction access
  - Each ring can access instruction in any of its outer rings
- The kernel of the OS runs in Kernel mode
- System calls transition between User and Kernel mode
