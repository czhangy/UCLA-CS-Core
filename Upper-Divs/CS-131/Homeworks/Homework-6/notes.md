# Secure Camera-based HVAC Control with D

## Goal

**Research the effectivenes of D as a potential platform for a proposed implementation of HVAC units**

## Problems

- C and C++ may be vulnerable to potential attacks
- Python and Java's complex structure, including the use of garbage collectors and interpreters, msy act as a weak point in the system

## Report

- The software must be clean and easy to audit
- The software must be a freestanding program, with no external OS
- The software should be as simple and stripped down as possible
- The software must be capable of interfacing with low-level hardware devices
- Focus on:
  - Security
  - Ease of use
  - Flexibility
  - Generality
  - Performance
  - Reliability
