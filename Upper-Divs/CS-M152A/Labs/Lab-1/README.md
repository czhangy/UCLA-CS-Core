# Sequencer

## Goal

**Use an FPGA to demo and study a sequencer and complete exercises based on the demo.**

## Requirements

- Translate and demo the following commands in the UART console

  - ```
    PUSH R0 0x4
    PUSH R0 0x0
    PUSH R1 0x3
    MULT R0 R1 R2
    ADD R2 R0 R3
    SEND R0
    SEND R1
    SEND R2
    SEND R3
    ```

- Complete workshop 1

- Complete workshop 2

## Deliverables

- Demo
  - [ ] Translate and demo the UART console of the following commands
  - [ ] Workshop 2
