# Sequencer

## Goal

**Use an FPGA to demo and study a sequencer and complete exercises based on the demo.**

## Requirements

- 

## Deliverables

- Coding
  - [ ] Implement the `PUSH` command
  - [ ] Implement the `ADD` command
  - [ ] Implement the `MULT` command
  - [ ] Implement the `SEND` command

- Demo

  - [ ] Demo the UART console of the following commands

    ```
    PUSH R0 0x4
    PUSH R0 0x0
    PUSH R1 0x3
    MULT R0 R1 R2
    ADD R2 R0 R3
    SEND R0
    SEND R1
    SEND R2
    SEND R3
    ```

  - [ ] Testbench code

  - [ ] Workshop 2

- Submission
  - [ ] Read the implementation code and finish workshop 1
  - [ ] Include results in the report
