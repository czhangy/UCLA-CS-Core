# Assignment 3

## To-Do

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Start the `webserver` binary with a static or dynamically generated config file that configures the port
- [ ] Use `curl` to issue a request to the server and capture the output
- [ ] Verify that the response from the server is correct
- [ ] Test the server's handling of invalid requests
- [ ] Shut the server down
- [ ] Exit with an exit code indicating either success (`0`) or failure (`1`)
- [ ] Structure the script to make it easy to expand on, without having the duplicate server setup/clean-up code
- [ ] Integrate the test with `ctest` by adding an `add_test` rule to `CMakeLists.txt`
- [ ] Merge into `main`
