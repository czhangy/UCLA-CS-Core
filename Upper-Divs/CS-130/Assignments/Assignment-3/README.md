# Assignment 3

## To-Do

### Integration Testing

- [x] Start the `webserver` binary with a static or dynamically generated config file that configures the port
- [x] Use `curl` to issue a request to the server and capture the output
- [x] Verify that the response from the server is correct
- [x] Shut the server down
- [x] Exit with an exit code indicating either success (`0`) or failure (`1`)
- [x] Structure the script to make it easy to expand on, without having the duplicate server setup/clean-up code
- [x] Integrate the test with `ctest` by adding an `add_test` rule to `CMakeLists.txt`
- [x] Merge into `main`

### Unit Testing

- [x] Add unit tests to reach >90% coverage

### Submission

- [x] Submit the IC [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0Q8d_xFWkkKEhfnDiZeJuSbWLi4LisbCs28vP-4kxNoTM6Q/viewform)
