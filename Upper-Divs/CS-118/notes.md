## Lecture 1: Introduction and Layering

- Is Networking Just Plumbing?
  - No, it's the new computational bus
    - Large tech companies have observed that even marginally slower network latencies will turn users away
  - And the new agile battlefield network
    - More stable communication during wartime
  - And still the world's communication channel
    - Infrastructure's reliance on the cloud => extremely strict reliability requirements
- So Why Study Networking?
  - Because it's already part of your life: the computational bus for services you need and the communication channel to stay connected
  - Because it's the hip place to be :)
- Packet Switching
  - In the early days, if two computers wanted to talk to each other, they would reserve megabits across connections
  - Len Kleinrock saw that this method produced very "bursty" traffic
    - Suggested the multiplexing of data, broken up into smaller units called packets
      - Post office model
      - More efficient sharing of data theoretically
  - Donald Davies showed how packets would produce easier reliability
    - If packet `B` gets dropped, you only need to resend `B`
  - Paul Baran showed how packets can make the system more robust
    - If a network path becomes unusable, data can still be sent
- Hat Transfer Analogy
  - The analogy:
    - Hazel's Hat => application
    - Bigwig => TCP
    - Post office => IP
    - Individual carriers => physical
  - Deeper issues with the analogy:
    - Equivalents of immigration and customs?
      - Security/authentication/etc.
    - Equivalents of postage?
      - Fixed amount of bandwidth from your ISP, which you can use to send data
      - Not charged per unit (bit)
    - Chopping up hats into slices as in data link?
      - Physical links are very narrow and constrained in size => leads to disassembly and reassembly
    - Out-of-band vs. in-band communication between layers
- Anatomy of a Web Transfer
  - End Device Networking
    - A typical laptop:
      - CPU
      - CPU Bus
      - Monitor
      - Main memory
      - Disk
      - Ethernet and wireless interface
  - IP Routing
    - System:
      - Sender domain
      - Internet service provider
      - Receiver domain
    - Forwarding: routers forward packets based on looking up destination addresses in a forwarding table
      - The real-time process â€“ you get ~5ns to forward a packet upon receiving it
    - Routing: routers work together to build a forwarding table
      - OSPF (within domains) and BGP (between ISPs)
      - Time scale is closer to being on the order of milliseconds
- Layering More Formally
  - Layering
    - Recall that in the Hazel's Hats analogy, we simplified a complex task (transferring hats) by outsourcing reliable transmission to an import-export agency who in turn outsourced package delivery to the post office who in turn oursourced single-hop package transmission to a carrier, etc.
    - Similarly, in networking, an email transfer is simplified by subcontracting reliable delivery to transport like TCP who subcontracts packet delivery to the network layer who subcontracts to the data link etc.
    - This division of labor in networking is called layering; each horizontal slice (layer) is given a number, starting with 1 for physical, 2 for data link. etc.
      - While TCP only uses the bottom 4 layers, the most general model is the OSI/ISO model
  - The OSI Model
    - Dated but conceptually useful
    - Application => presentation => session => transport (TCP) => network (IP) => data link (Ethernet) => physical
      - Transport: segments
      - Network: packets
      - Data link: frames
      - Physical: bits/symbols
  - Layering Concepts
    - Protocol: rules governing horizontal communication between peer layer entities
    - Interface: rules governing vertical communication between a layer `N` entity and a layer `N+1` entity on the same computer
    - PDU: Protocol Data Units are the messages that are exchanged between peer entities
      - `N`-PDU between layer `N`-entities
      - On the Internet: a TPDU is a segment, an NPDU is a packet, and a DPDU is a frame
    - SDU: data unit passed across an interface
      - `N`-SDU is passed to and from layer `N` from layer `N+1`
    - PDU vs. SDU: normally `N`-PDU is `N`-SDU together with a layer `N` header
      - However, one SDU can be split into multiple PDUs if the protocol allows only small PDUs
    - Watch those headers!
      - Communication between layer entities shares physical medium by using a layer header for each layer in each message
        - Think of data in envelope with transport header, stuffed in envelope with routing header, stuffed in envelope with data link header
      - Sharing headers saves postage and also trivially coordinates headers with corresponding data (compared to out-of-band transmission between headers)
      - Strict layering: each layer only looks at its header and interface data to do its job
        - Software engineering: changes to one layer do not cause other layers to be reimplemented
        - Information can be passed between layers via interface
      - As data moves down the layers, each layer adds its header
      - As data moves up the layers, each layer strips off its header
  - The Hourglass Model
    - There's a huge variety of options at the application/transport layer and at the data link/physical layer, but a single interface at the network layer (IP)
      - Also limited at the transport layer (TCP vs. UDP)
- The IP Abstractions
  - Each layer provides a service to the layer above it
  - TCP is the abstraction of two bidirectionally-connected queues
    - One machine writes to the queue and the other reads from the queue
    - Abstracts away the lower levels
  - Routing is the abstraction of finding a route that the data will travel through



## Lecture 2: Limits to Transmission

- Review

  - The physical layer is responsible for transporting individual bits
  - The data link layer allows us to include headers
  - The IP layer routes from source to location
  - The TCP layer packetizes and sends from a sender queue to a receiver queue
    - Packetizes => takes the byte stream and breaks it up into smaller chunks
    - Promotes reliability through acknowledgements and guarantee that everything that has been sent is read
  - Headers
    - TCP header contains the payload packet and a sequence number
    - IP header contains the origin and destination IP addresses
    - The data link header contains the origin and destination MAC addresses
      - MAC address is one interface of the router => location independent
        - IP addresses are location dependent
      - `yx` => to MAC address `y` from `x`
    - Headers are stripped away at each corresponding letter
  - Strict Layering
    - Each layer only looks at its header and interface data to do its job
      - Modularity
      - Information can be passed between layers via interface
    - As data moves down the layers, each layer adds its header; as data moves up, each layer strips off its header
  - In Class Example:
    - `S` (Sender) => Sender TCP => Sender IP => Sender Data Link => Router Data Link => Router IP => Router Data Link => Receiver Data Link => Receiver IP => Receiver TCP => `R` (Receiver)
    - Only the data link information changes from sender to receiver

- Limits to Transmission

  - Main idea: there are limits to the speed at which bits can be transmitted between a sender and a receiver over a channel based on how fast the channel can react (bandwidth) and the noise

  - Physical Layer Abstraction

    - Sending a bit over a channel
      - How fast can we transmit?
      - How do we decide when to sample?
      - How do different forms of media impact this transmission?

  - The Foundation: Sending Bits

    - A three-step process:
      - Take an input stream of bits (digital data)
      - Modulate some physical media to send data (analog)
      - Demodulate the signal to retrieve bits (digital again)
    - No boundaries at the physical layer => boundaries at the data link layer

  - Now in More Detail

    - We will divide the physical layer into sublayers, starting with a coding layer (semaphores have codes as well)
      - The bottom sublayer is really describing the essential properties of the media (frequency response, bit error rate)
      - The middle sublayer describes properties of particular media (e.g., satellites, coaxial cable, fiber, etc.)
      - The top sublayer is about things like clock recovery, synchronization, etc.
    - To understand the Shannon Limit, we have to understand what bandwidth means in Hz (EE idea) and why it's related to bandwidth in bits/sec (CS idea)
    - To do so we need to take a small painless detour into the world of signals, systems, and Fourier Analysis

  - Bottom Sublayer: Signal Transmission and Limits

    - How fast can you send, and what prevents you from sending faster?

    - Sending bits to a receiver:

      - Goal: to send a sequence of `0`s and `1`s from a sender to a receiver by sending energy (e.g., light, electricity) over a channel (e.g., fiber, cable)
        - Ex) One coding: `0` = no energy, `1` = energy
      - Problem: real channels distort input energy signals, leading to two questions:
        - How can we predict what a given channel will do to an input signal given some properties of the channel?
          - Fourier analysis
        - How does distortion affect maximum bit rate?
          - Nyquist (sluggishness) and Shannon (noise) limits

    - Signals and Channels

      - Signal: energy (e.g., voltage and light) that varies with time
        - Continuous and discrete
        - Periodic
        - Period and frequency
      - Channel: physical medium that conveys energy from a sender to a receiver (e.g., a fiber link) with possible distortion

    - Sine Waves

      - Sine waves are spvial because all signals can be rewritten in terms of sine waves

      - Mathematically:

        - $$
          A\sin(2\pi ft+\theta)
          $$

        - `A` is max value (amplitude)

        - `f` is frequence

        - `Î¸` is initial phase shift

      - Express angle in radians!

    - Fournier Analysis: The Big Picture

      - If we forget about noise, most channels are "nice" to sine waves
        - A sine wave of frequency `f` is always scaled by a fixed factor `s(f)` and phase shifted by a fixed amount `p(f)`, regardless of amplitude
      - Thus, we can completely describe a channel by plotting the values of `s(f)` (frequency response) and `p(f)` (phase response) for all values of frequency `f`
      - To find what happens to arbitrary signal `S`, we:
        - Use Fourier Analysis to rewrite `S` as a sum of sine waves of different frequencies
        - Use frequency and phase response to see the effect on each sine wave
        - Add scaled sine waves to find output signal

    - Bandwidth

      - A range of frequencies for which a channel passes signal through; not very precise
      - More bandwidth, more fidelity
      - More fidelity, better recovery of bits

    - Sluggishness and Noise

      - Most channels are sluggish (they take time to respond) because they turn a deaf ear to high frequencies in the input signal
        - Thus, lower bandwidth channels are more sluggish
      - What about noise?
        - Different models for different channels
        - Simplest and common model: white noise (uniformly distributed at all frequencies and normally distributed within a frequency)

    - Sampling Bits

      - Receivers recover the bits in the output signal by sampling output signal close to middle of bit period
      - Two limits to bit rate: Nyquist (channel bandwidth) and Shannon (noise)
      - When a signal is sent, the output will be a sinc wave
        - When can we send the next wave?
        - Nyquist noticed that sending every `T/2` works since the peak of the current signal lines up with the zeroes of past bits
          - Assuming bandwidth is `1/T`, the max bit rate is `2/T` or 2 times the bandwidth
        - We can play with the voltage to send more bits

    - Baud Rate and Bit Rate

      - To prevent ISI (inter-symbol interference), we cannot send "symbols" faster than `2B` times per second
        - Nyquist rate is the max rate of sending symbols, not bits (baud rate)
      - But as we saw, each symbol in a signal can carry multiple bits
      - With `L` signal levels, bit rate is `log L` times baud rate
      - Noise prevents us from transmitting many signal levels

    - The Shannon Bound

      - `S` is the maximum signal amplitude

      - `N` is the maximum noise amplitude

      - `log(S/2N)` bits per signal, `2B` signals/sec (Nyquist)

      - Naive bound is:

        - $$
          2B\log\left(\frac{S}{2N}\right)
          $$

      - Shannon bound is:

        - $$
          B\log\left(1+\frac{S}{2N}\right)
          $$

      - The real Shannon bound does not have the factor of `2` and has an extra `1` added

        - This is because our simple model was only for a simple coding and for fixed, deterministic noise

      - Shannon bound works for any coding scheme (frequency, phase modulation) and for Gaussian additive noise

        - Needs a deep probabilistic argument

  - Bit Rate vs. Frequency

    - A higher bit rate (each bit lasts a smaller time) leads to a higher frequency wave



## Lecture 3: Clock Recovery

- Bandwidth and the Shannon Bound (cont.)

  - Higher bit rate => higher frequency wave
    - Note that, roughly, bit rate = frequency
  - What does this intuition tell us?
    - A higher bit rate (each bit lasts a smaller time) leads to a higher frequency wave
    - We must cover a range of frequencies to adapt to any bit pattern
  - From Nyquist to Shannon
    - If we have a bandwidth of `B`, we can send `2B` signals per second
    - Each signal can be multilevel => these levels must be spaced apart to distinguish between them

- Clock Recovery

  - Main idea: receivers learn when to sample the continuous wave received from sender by cueing on transitions

  - Recall:

    - Sending bits is a three-step process:
      - Take an input stream of bits (digital)
      - Modulate some physical media to send data (analog)
      - Demodulate the signal to retrieve bits (digital)

  - What does the physical layer do?

    - A possibly faulty, single-hop, bit pipe that connects a sender to possibly multiple receivers
    - Morse Code analogy:
      - Example bit pipe: sending Morse Code to receivers using a flashlight
      - Issues:
        - Fundamental limits: brain-eye system processing limits leads to Inter Symbol Interference
        - Media issues: flashlight, semaphore
        - Coding: Morse Code, getting in sync, knowing receiver rate
    - Sublayers:
      - Input stream => coding sublayer => coded stream => media transmission sublayer => input signal => signal transmission sublayer => output signal => media reception sublayer => coded stream => decoding sublayer => output stream

  - Sampling Bits

    - Receivers recover the bits in the input signal by ssmpling output signal close to middle of bit period
    - Two limits to bit rate: channel bandwidth (Nyquist) and noise (Shannon)

  - Main Topic

    - How does a receiver know when to sample bits, and how can the sender help?
    - By cueing on transitions ensured by sender sending "extra bits"

  - Who needs a clock anyways?

    - How to initially synchronize receiver clock with sender clock?
      - Initial training bits
    - Stay in sync (first cut): receiver has a very similar clock as sender (say both run at 1GHz)
    - Problem: all real physical clocks drift over time
      - Crucial at high speeds
      - Small drift leads to sampling error
      - How do we keep in sync?
        - Transitions

  - Transitions and Coding

    - Example: parse: "nohewontgosoon"
      - Need spaces and punctuations to parse speech
    - Stream of bits without transitions (change in signal value) is equally hard to parse
    - Real data may contain all `0`s, so how w can you ensure transitions?
      - Coding => adds cost
    - Code to ensure that every `n` bits, you get at least `m` transitions
      - Different coding schemes parameterized by `m` and `n`

  - Asynchronous Coding

    - Codes a character (assume 8 bits in ASCII)
    - We add "extra" start bits to get into sync and one or two stop bits
      - `1` is encoded as high voltage, `0` as low

  - Receiver code assumes:

    - Edge detector: a hardware gadget used to tell whether a `0` goes to a `1` or a `1` to a `0` that we abstract as a function to tell where a transition is

    - Sampling: we abstract sampling and compare it to a threshold as a function `SampleSignal`

    - Clock drift: receiver has a clock that runs at approximately the same rate as sender

    - ```pseudocode
      Data Structures:
      C[0..10]; ARRAY, to store bits in current character
      
      On Transition:
      	StartTimer(1/2 bit) // Don't sample on an edge
      	For (i = 0 to 10), do
      		Wait(TimerExpiry);
      		C[i] = SampleSignal;
      		StartTimer(1 bit) // Wait for next bit
      	End;
      	If (C[0] = 1) and (C[9] = C[10] = 0) then Output C[1..8];
      ```

  - Slow Clock Problem

    - How much slower can the receiver clock be without causing bit errors? => 5%
    - Can drift by 50% per bit => 10 bits => 5% drift per bit

  - Synchronous Transmission

    - Lots of start bits (preamble) + up to 12000 bits + lots of stop bits (postamble)
    - Same as asynchronous except larger frame sizes
    - Requires better clock tolerance and more sophisticated coding

  - Why Synchronous Transmission?

    - For clock recovery, receiver must know when to start its receive clock (phase)
      - Then can sample the line at periodic intervals at the same rate as sender clock with some help from transitions in data
    - In asynchronous, receiver gets locked in phase when voltage goes from low to high (start bit)
      - Need to have fairly large idle time between characters for receiver to get locked in phase for each character
      - Slows transmission and limits it to low rates
    - Two overheads for start bit: extra bit + extra time needed for reliable detection
      - Starting up receiver clock is expensive
    - In synchronous, we put a large number of start bits at the front of a large number of data bits
      - Allows the start-up overhead to be amortized

  - Manchester Encoding

    - Signal to data:
      - High to low transition (`10`) => `1`
      - Low to high transition (`01`) => `0`
    - Comments:
      - Solves clock recovery problem
        - Transitions re-sync clocks every time they occur
      - Only 50% efficient (1/2 bit per transition)
      - Still need preamble (typically `0101010101...`) with a trailing `11` in Ethernet
    - Getting Locked in Phase
      - In asynchronous, you get in phase by a single `0` to `1` transition
        - Not very reliable in the presence of noise
      - But in Manchester, a sequence of `0`s sent can be read off as a sequence of `1`s if the receiver is out of phase
      - In Manchester, you get in phase by sending a preamble or group of start bits of the form `01` repeating, in which the only transitions are at mid-bit
        - Easy to recognize and get locked in phase
        - End with `11` to know where data starts
        - Full preamble is `0101010101...11`
        - Can't count because we don't know how long the receiver will take to get in phase => once it's in phase, it can watch out for the `11`

  - Phase Locked Loops

    - Once you lock in at the start of a data unit, you can rely on accuracy of receiver clock frequency (as in asynchronous)
      - Can't do this if the data unit is large
    - Could try resetting receiver clock on every observed transition
      - Susceptible to noise
      - Better to use more gradual adjustment
    - Phase locked loops measure phase difference and speed up or slow down the receiver clock to reduce phase difference
      - Commonly used

  - Modern Codes

    - 8-10 coding: every group of 8 data bits is encoded as 10 bits
      - Easily done by table lookup
      - Removes bit patterns with no transitions
      - Look up tables get too big if we try to go higher
    - Why transitions?
      - Because all 10-bit patterns with no transitions (`0000000000` and `1111111111`) are not used
      - In fact, we can rule out even patterns with 1 transition as we have 1024 patterns to code a byte
    - Receiver decoding: a 1024 entry table that looks up the 8-bit data corresponding to each received 10-bit pattern

  - What Makes a Code Good?

    - Coding efficiency: real bits/coded bits
    - Signal-to-noise ratio
    - DC balance
    - Implementation complexity

  - Eye Patterns

    - A way to superimpose arbitrary bit sequences on screen as opposed to sending them in parallel
    - In a perfect system, we will have a well-defined eye
      - Should sample at the center of the eye
      - Nice visual test of line quality

  - Broadband Coding

    - Baseband coding uses energy levels such as voltage or light
      - In broadband coding, information is modulated on a carrier wave of a certain frequency
      - Used by modems
    - Modulation refers to changing the properties of the carrier to communicate the required information
      - Frequency Shift Keying: high frequency encodes a `1`, low encodes a `0`
      - Amplitude Shift Keying: high amplitude encodes a `1`
    - Baseband vs. Broadband
      - Baseband modulation: send the "bare" signal
      - e.g., +5V for `1`, -5V for `0`
      - All signals fall in the same frequency range
      - Broadband modulation
        - Use the signal to modulate a high-frequency signal (carrier)
        - Can be viewed as the product of two signals
    - Digital Modulation Methods
      -  Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
      - Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
      - Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

  - Summary

    - Clock synchronization: getting receiver clock in sync with sender transmission using transitions guaranteed by a code
    - Coding schemes: asynchronous (transitions at start and end, small number of bits) vs. synchronous (many transitions in start and guaranteed transitions in data as well)
    - Real engineering: phase locked loops (not programs we used), and eye patterns to visualize
    - Broadband coding: modulate `1`s and `0`s on a high frequency carrier wave in wireless and cable modems



## Lecture 4: Media

- Main idea: to architect a large network, one needs to use different types of media at different places in the network

- Pumping Bits Globally

  - Last Mile Bottleneck
    - Use twisted pair, cable, radio
  - Crowded City Bottleneck
    - Hard to install more wires
    - A lot of contention for wireless
    - Use microwave, radio
  - Trans-Oceanic Bottleneck
    - Use fiber, satellite

- Review: Where is the Physical Layer

  - Roughly, what happens which I click on a webpage?
    - Web request => turn click into HTTP request
    - Name resolution => check DNS for where the webpage is
    - Data transport => break message into packets/TCP segments
      - Should be delivered reliably and in-order
      - "And let me know when they got there" => retransmits if the request times out
    - Network layer => address each packet so it can traverse network and arrive at host
    - Network routing in IP => each router forwards destination
    - Data link scheduling (Ethernet) => break message into frames
      - Media Access Control (MAC)
      - "Can I send now? Can I send now?"
    - Physical layer

- Why Study Media?

  - Media affects protocol design
    - Low bandwidth led to tight encoding
      - Early phone lines, not needed for LANs
    - Broadcast LANs led to use of Multicast
      - Initialization and free copies, to IP multicast
    - Building wiring led to switching
      - Wiring closest to hubs to ATM 
    - Fiber led to rings
      - Point-to-point fibers lead to rings
    - Fiber led to Digital
      - Long haul telephone network becomes digital
    - Wireless leads to low bandwidths again
      - Laptops; need IPv6 compression on wireless links
  - We need to understand media tradeoffs when architecting networks
    - Think of flashlights vs. semaphores in the Morse Code analogy

- Twisted Pair Copper

  - Low bandwidth
  - Cheap, easy to install
  - Using twisted pair for higher rates today:
    - Standard twisted pair is limited by loading cables by telephone company to 4MHz
      - Shannon limit is around 56Kbps (not counting compression)
    - Two alternatives:
      - Better quality twisted pair cables for local area networks
        - e.g., Cat 3, Cat 5
      - Telephone company removes loading cables, reduces your length, and gives you ADSL
        - Asymmetrical

- Baseband Cable

  - e.g., Ethernet
  - High bandwidth (10-100MHz)
  - Hard to tap, expensive to install
  - Small distance (1-3km without repeaters)
  - Using coaxial cable today:
    - Coaxial cable has high bandwidth
      - Used for original 10Mbps Ethernet, but very clunky
      - Twisted pair used today
    - Cable still used in cable networks for cable TV and for data via cable modems
    - Divide bandwidth into 6MHz channels for each TV channel and one 6MHz channel for downstream data
    - Theoretically can reach 30Mbps but beware other users and bandwidth limits
      - Upstream much less

- Fiber Optics

  - Huge bandwidth (10 million MHz)
  - Can span continents with repeaters
  - Almost impossible to tap => point-to-point secure
  - Excellent electrical isolation
  - Thin and easy to install
  - Optics still expensive
  - Unidirectional
  - Modal Dispersion
    - The long path reaches the output slower
    - Can't send the next bit if the fast path of the next bit reaches the output before the slow path of the original bit
      - Inter-symbol interference
    - Solution: single mode fiber
  - Chromatic Dispersion
    - Different lights go at different speeds through glass
    - Spreads the signal out at output => can't send next bit until output width or you get ISI
    - Solution: use monochromatic light

- Wireless

  - Widely varying channel bandwidths/distances
  - Extremely vulnerable to noise and interference
  - Lower frequencies are omnidirectional, go through obstacles, and have lower speed
  - Higher frequencies are directional, get absorbed by obstacles, and have higher speed
  - Spectrum Allocation
    - Policy approach forces spectrum to be allocated like a fixed spatial resource
    - Reality is that spectrum is time and power shared
    - Measurements show that fixed allocations are poorly utilized
  - Wireless Data Options
    - 802.11: wireless LANs using a wireless access point (AP) at hotspot using unlicensed frequency band 2.4 to 4.485GHz (radio frequency)
      - 100m
      - Needs hotspot, but common and very cheap
      - AP configured with an SSID that you can see when doing "View Available Networks" and a channel number from 1 to 11
        - Non-overlapping channels (e.g., 1, 6, 11) can be used to triple bandwidth
      - Each AP periodically sends a beacon containing SSID
      - Each station scans all 11 channels looking for beacons to get list of networks
        - Some choice of AP and mobile sets up an association
      - Access protocol to send data is tricky because of hidden terminal problem
        - `A` and `B` can communicate with same output, but be unaware of one another, resulting in interference at the output
    - Bluetooth: ad hoc personal area networks with no AP
      - Master-slave
      - 4Mbps
    - WiMax: broader geographical range, smaller bandwidth of a few Mbps
    - 3G: cellular telephone networks carrying data at a few Mbps such as EVDO

    - Microwave
      - Avoids right of way
      - May be cheaper than installing cable

      - Has problems with rain
      - Up to 100km distance
    - Geosync Satellite
      - Avoides right of way
      - Good bandwidth
        - Limited from larger bandwidth due to limited sky space
      - Worldwide span
      - Large latency due to need to be geosynchronous
        - In order to be geosynchronous, the satellite must be far from Earth
      - Antenna cost: antenna need not be steerable due to the geosynchronous nature of satellites
      - Low Orbiting Satellites
        - Surround Earth with low-orbiting satellites
        - Perform handoffs between satellites instead of staying connected to same satellite
        - Requires a lot of satellites to be performant

## Lecture 5: Framing

- Data Link Sublayers
  - Point-to-Point Links (2 nodes)
    - Bits => Framing => Error detection => Error recovery (optional) => Frames
  - Broadcast Links (â‰¥2 notes)
    - Bits => Framing => Error detection => Media access => Multiplexing => Frames
    - Shared resources have to worry about collision, as there are multiple users across the same network
  - From a high-level view, the data link layer takes bits and provides frames
  - Quasi-reliable 1 hop frame pipe
    - If something is corrupted, it will be detected and trashed at the data link layer with extremely high probability
- Five Functions of Data Link
  - Framing: breaking up a stream of bits into units called frames so that we can add extra information like  destination addresses and checksums to frames (required)
    - First, as frames are required for error detection
  - Error detection: using extra redundant bits called checksums to detect whether any bit in the frame was received incorrectly (required)
  - Media access: there exist multiple senders, so we need traffic control to decide who sends next (required for broadcast links)
  - Multiplexing: allowing multiple clients to use data link; needs some info in the frame header to identify the client (optional)
  - Error recovery: go beyond error detection and take recovery action by retransmitting when frames are lost or corrupted (optional)
- Why Not Perform Error Recovery at Each Hop?
  - End-to-end argument
    - We need end-to-end or transport error recovery anyways
      - The only real guarantees are end-to-end => sender TCP to receiver TCP
      - Redundant, more overhead and buffering
    - Can't trust a series of hop-by-hop schemes because:
      - Crashes and other losses at intermediate nodes
      - Transport must work over both reliable and unreliable links
    - Used in old networking due to greater link unreliability
    - Thus, hop-by-hop is only a performance optimization
    - Extra cost (acknowledgement messages, buffering, etc.) not worth it when error rate is low
      - Worth it (quicker recovery, less wasted resources) when error rate is high and the latency of end-to-end recovery is unacceptable (within a compute cluster or storage area network)
- Why Framing?
  - Without framing, the bitstream is reserved for one sender and one client per sender
    - Need frames to add multiplexing information like destination addresses and destination client names
  - Frames offer a small manageable unit for error recovery and error detection
    - Add checksums to frames for error detection and sequence numbers, etc. for error recovery
- How Framing?
  - Flags and Bit Stuffing
    - Use special bit patterns or flags to delimit (i.e., mark boundaries) frames
    - Need bit stuffing to "encode" the user data to not contain the flags (e.g., HDLC)
  - Start Flags and Character Count
    - Use flags to indicate the start of data and a bit count to indicate end of frame
    - Bit stuffing not needed, but less robust (e.g., DDCMP)
  - Flags Supplied by Physical Layer
    - Use special physical layer symbols to delimit frames

- Fixed-Length Frames
  - Easy to manage for receiver
    - Well understood buffering requirements
  - Introduces inefficiencies for variable length payloads
    - May waste space (padding) for small payloads
    - Larger payloads need to be fragmented across many frames
    - Very common inside switches/routers
  - Requires explicit design tradeoff

- Length-Based Framing
  - Start | Length | Payload
  - To avoid overhead, we'd like variable-length frames
    - Each frame declares how long it is
    - e.g., DECNet DDCMP
  - What's the issue with an explicit length field?
    - Must correctly read the length field (bad if corrupted)
      - Need to decode while receiving
    - Still need to identify the beginning
- Sentinel-Based Framing
  - Allow for variable-length frames
  - Idea: mark start/end of frame with special "marker"
    - Byte pattern, bit pattern, signal pattern, etc.
    - But, we must make sure the pattern doesn't appear in the data
  - Two solutions:
    - Special non-data physical-layer symbol
      - Code efficiency (can't use symbol for data)?
    - Stuffing
      - Dynamically remove marker bit patterns from data stream
      - Receiver "unstuffs" data stream to reconstruct original data

- Stuffing Design by Sublayering
  - Frame => Stuffer => Add flags => Physical layer => Remove flags => Destuffer
  - Sublayering is a good design technique within layers as well
  - What happens if input data contains `01111110`? If the receiver gets `111110`?
- Byte Stuffing
  - Same as bit stuffing, except at byte (character) level
    - Generally have two different flags: STX and ETX
    - Found in DDCMP, BISYNC, etc.
  - Need to stuff if either appears in the payload
    - Prefix with another special character, CLE (data-link escape)
    - New problem: what if DLE appears in payload
  - Stuff DLE with DLE, like escape characters
    - Could be as bad as 50% efficient to send all DLEs
- The Engineering Solution
  - Ask the physical layer for more symbols that are never used in data
  - Easily possible in 4-5 encoding, as we have 16 data symbols, but 32 possible encoded values
  - Even after ruling out `00000` and `11111` we still have 14 unused symbols
  - Change interface to allow sending one of 16 data symbols (`0000` to `1111`) and special symbols for start of frame (SOF) and end of frame (EOF)
- Useful Principles
  - Each layer or sublayer exacts its penalty: e.g., clock recovery coding, framing bits
  - The end-to-end argument
  - Lower layers should not depend for correctness on assumptions about higher layers
  - All layers have some common problems to solve: e.g., synchronization, multiplexing
  - The best principles will/should be violated for pragmatic reasons
  - Layering and sublayering are a good way to understand and design new protocols



## Lecture 6: Error Detection

- Summary of Framing Techniques

  - Silence
    - Requires access to 3 levels
    - Ethernet
  - Special Pattern
    - If you are already using some encoding like 8-10, we can use an unused encoding
  - Bit Stuffing

- Big question: how can we add just 32 bits to a frame and detect almost any error with very high probability?

- Goal: Quasi-Reliability

  - The probability of a receiving data link passing up an incorrect frame to the client layer should be very, very small

    - Undetected error once in ~20 years
    - Needs to be so small because transport protocols do not insist on end-to-end checksums, a violation of the end-to-end argument

  - The probability of a receiving data link dropping frames sent by the sender should be small (once a day) to allow good performance

  - Add checksums to detect as large of a burst as possible, as many random (at least 3) errors as possible, and to detect any error pattern with a very high probability of:

    - $$
      1-\frac{1}{2^{32}}
      $$

- Types of Errors

  - Random errors: a noise spike or ISI makes you think a `0` is a `1` or a `1` is a `0`
  - Burst errors: a group of bits get corrupted because of synchronization or a connector is plugged in => correlated!
    - Modeling burst error: burst error of length `k` => distance from first to last is `k - 1`
      - Middle bits may or may not have been corrupted
  - Comparison:
    - Imagine a frame of size 1000 and an error rate of 1 in 1000
    - If random, all frames corrupted on average
    - If we get a burst of 1000 every 1000 frames, only 1 is lost

- Going Beyond Parity

  - Parity: XOR of bits
    - Can detect all odd bit errors in a frame
    - Can't detect 2 bit errors
  - Would like to do better than parity using so-called checksums for detecting larger number of errors (happens often) by adding more check bits (32 vs. 1)
    - Big picture: checksum as a hash => unlikely for the error to hash into the same value

- Basic Idea

  - If the receiver find s that `H' = Hash(M')`, then receiver passes `M'` up to the higher layer, otherwise it drops the frame
  - If `M` is not equal to `M'` and `H' = Hash(M')`, we have an undetected error
    - If errors are random and hash is also random in a 32-bit domain, then the probability of this occurring is only `1/2^32`

- Gentle Intro to Checksums

  - Telephone Exchange
    - Imagine you were sending a lot of numbers to a friend over a phone, and then end by sending the sum
    - Error detection: if the sum your friend receives is not the sum of the numbers she received, then there's an error
    - Undetected errors: an error that corrupts two numbers so that the sum works out
    - CRCs: instead of being based on addition, they're based on division
      - Also works using `mod 2`, but it's simplest to start with ordinary division

- Ordinary Division Checksum

  - Consider message `M` and generator `G` to be binary integers

  - Let `r` be the number of bits in `G`

  - We find the remainder `t` or `2^rM` when divided by `G`

    - Why not just `M`? So we can separate the checksum from the message at the receiver by looking at the last `r` bits

  - Thus:

    - $$
      2^rM=kG+t\\
      2^rM+G-t=(k+1)G
      $$

    - So we add a checksum `c = G - t` to the shifted message and the result should divide `G`

  - Has reasonable properties, however, integer division is hard to implement

    - Prefer to do without carries

- The Big Idea

  - In ordinary division checksums, we transmitted a message plus a checksum that was divisible by the generator `G`
    - Thus any errors that cause the resulting number to not be divisible by `G` (invalid codewords) will be detected
  - In CRCs, we do the same thing, except we use `mod 2` arithmetic instead of ordinary arithmetic
  - `mod 2` arithmetic: addition and subtraction are XORs so there is no carry
    - Can implement at high speeds

- Modulo 2 Arithmetic

  - No carries: repeated addition does not result in multiplication

  - Multiplication is normal is normal except for no carries

    - Shift and XOR instead of shift and add

  - Similar algorithm to ordinary division

    - Again, let `r` be the number of bits in `G`
    - We find the remainder `c` of `2^r-1 M` when divided by `G`

  - Thus, `2^r-1M = kG + c`, thus:

    - $$
      2^{r-1}M-c=kG\\
      2^{r-1}M+c=kG
      $$

    - Send `c` as checksum

  - How `mod 2` Division Works

    - For CRC, we need to repeatedly add `mod 2` multiples of the generator until we get a number that is `r - 1` bits long that is the remainder

    - The only way to reduce number of bits in `mod 2` arithmetic is to remove the MSB by adding `mod 2` a number with a `1` in the same position

    - ```pseudocode
      While no more bits:
      	If MSB = 1, XOR with generator
      	Shift out MSB and shift in next bit
      ```

- Implementing CRCs

  - The current remainder is held in a register initialized with the first `r` bits of the message
  - If the MSB of the current remainder is `1`, then XOR the current remainder with the divisor; if the MSB is `0`, then do nothing
  - Shift the current remainder 1 bit to the left and shift in the next message bit
  - Faster to shift more bits at a time using a table of precomputed checksums

- CRC: Polynomial View

  - `101` and `011` can be represented as `X^2 + 1` and `X + 1`

    - `X^i` term iff the `i`th bit is `1`

  - Normal addition: `X^2 + X + 2`

    - No carries between powers
    - `+2` is bad: fix by using `mod 2` addition to get `X^2 + X`
      - Applies to `X` terms as well

  - Can think of CRC computation as dividing  a shifted message polynomial (multiplied by `x^r-1`) by CRC divisor polynomial and adding remainder

  - Equivalent to arithmetic view, but polynomial is easier to analyze

  - Errors in Polynomial View

    - We model bit errors in positions `i`, `j`, `k`, etc. as the channel adding an error polynomial:

      - $$
        X^i+X^j+X^k+\cdots
        $$

    - Since the message polynomial divides the generator, the error will not be detected iff the error polynomial divides the generator

      - Or in other words if one cannot multiply the generator by another polynomial to get the error polynomial

  - Properties:

    - CRC-16:

      - $$
        X^{16}+X^{15}+X^2+1
        $$

      - Error results in adding in a polynomial => use normal polynomial multiplication intuition

    - Single-bit errors: result in addition of `X^i`

      - If `G(x)` has at least two terms, any multiple of `G(x)` will have two terms

    - Two-bit errors correspond to adding `X^i + X^j`



## Lecture 7: Error Recovery

- Error Detection

  - If the error polynomial divides the generator, we have a problem => undetected error

    - $$
      \frac{M(x)+E(x)}{G(x)}=\frac{M(x)}{G(x)}+\frac{E(x)}{G(x)}
      $$

  - CRCs want to detect:

    - All 1-bit errors

      - As long as the generator has 2 terms, there is no way a single-term error polynomial can be generated

    - All 2-bit errors

    - All odd-bit errors

    - All bursts of size degree of CRC

    - Every kind of error with probability:

      - $$
        1-\frac{1}{2^d}
        $$

  - Implementing CRCs

    - The current remainder is held in a register initialized with the first `r` bits of the message
    - If MSB of current remainder is `1`, then XOR the current remainder with divisor, if the MSB is `0`, do nothing
    - Shift the current remainder `1` bit to the left and shift in next message bit
    - Faster to shift, say, 8 bits at a time (your assignment) using a table of 256 precomputed checksums of all possible 8-bit checksums

  - CRC in Hardware

    - Registers `R0` through `R4` are several single-bit registers corresponding to the single multi-bit register
    - XOR placed to the right of register `i` if bit `i` is set in the register
    - When a message bit shits in, all registers send (in parallel) their bit values to the left, some through XOR gates
      - Combines left shift of an iteration with MSB check and XOR of next iteration
      - XOR during left shift
    - Avoids check for MSB: output of `R4` as input to all XORs
    - In practice, to implement at terabits, we need to shift multiple bits (say 8) per clock cycle using table lookup

  - Back to the Big Picture

    - How can we add just 32 bits and catch all errors with high probability?

  - Hamming Distance

    - Recall, we used CRCs to do better than parity using so-called checksums for detecting a larger number of errors (happens often)
      - An idea called Hamming distance explains why some codes detect and correct more bits
    - Hamming distance between two strings `S` and `R` is the number of bit positions at which they differ

  - Error Detection as Coding

    - Computation view: add bits to the end of a frame for detecting errors
      - Parity adds 1, CRC adds 32
    - Coding view: we take every packet `P` and encode it as a frame `F = C(P)` in any way you wish
      - One way is to add a checksum but there are other examples
      - After coding, some codewords are valid and some are invalid
      - Allows us to abstract across details of code and use Hamming distance
    - Triple code: imagine we encode every bit in `P` as 3 identical bits in `F`

  - CRCs and Hamming Distance

    - While CRCs are really chosen for burst detection, then Hamming distances are also important
    - CRC-32 layers have a Hamming distance of 5 for frame sizes less than 360B and 4 for larger frames
      - CRC-32 is used in 802.11, Ethernet, SATA, etc.
      - This implies that CRC-32 can detect 4 random bit errors for most frames
        - Actually 5 because of odd-bit guarantee
    - There is a special 32-bit polynomial called CRC32K by Koopman that has Hamming distance of 6 fairly large frame sizes

  - Hamming Distance, Detection, and Correction

    - Can detect `d` random bit errors if Hamming distance is `d + 1`, because flipping `d` bits cannot move from valid codeword to another
    - Can correct `d` errors if Hamming distance is `2d + 1`
      - Assign invalid codewords to closest codeword

- Error Recovery

  - Why Error Recovery at Data Link?

    - Used later: protocols like TCP use the same ideas
    - Still used at data link: some existing protocols like HDLC and Fiber still do error recovery at data link
    - Non-trivial protocol: our first example of the problems caused by varying message delay and errors (frame loss, crashes)
    - Technology seesaw: hop-by-hop becoming popular again to reduce latency

  - Correctness Specification

    - Packets given to the sending data link must be delivered to the receiver without duplication, loss, or mis-ordering

  - Assumptions

    - Assumes error detection: assumes undetected error rate small enough to be ignored
    - Loss as well as errors: whole frames can be lost in a way not detected by error detection
    - FIFO: physical layer is FIFO
    - Arbitrary delay: delay on links is arbitrary and can vary from frame to frame

  - Motivations for Stop and Wait Protocol

    - Loss: first packet drops and second arrives
      - Must retransmit
    - Duplication: packet is received, but sender resends before `ack` arrives
      - Must defend against early retransmits
    - Livelock: cannot throw away duplicates, as the data might have duplicates
      - Need sequence numbers
      - If the `ack` fails, then the receiver is expecting the next sequence number, but the sender is stuck resending the first packet
        - Must `ack` even duplicates
    - Loss: receiver sent an `ack` for a a previous packet but was interpreted by a sender as an `ack` for a later packet
      - Must number `ack`s

  - Going Deeper

    - Correctness: how do we show it works in all cases (infinite sequence of executions)? => invariants
    - Sequence number: do we need an infinite number of bits? => no
    - Performance: send only one at a time, bad over satellites, can do better => sliding window
    - Initialization: how do we get started and synchronize sequence numbers in the face of crashes?

  - Naive Code for Stop and Wait

    - Sender code:

      - ```pseudocode
        Sender keeps state variable SN, initially 0, and repeats the following loop
        
        Loop forever:
        	Accept a new packet from higher layer and store it in buffer B
        	Transmit a frame (SN, B)
        	If (ACK, R) frame received and R != SN, then
          	SN = R
        		Go to beginning of loop
        	Else if the previous condition does not occur after T sec
        		Re-transmit
        ```

    - Receiver code:

      - ```pseudocode
        Receiver keeps state variable RN, initially 0
        
        When an error-free data frame (S, D) is received:
        	On receipt:
        		If S = RN then:
        			Pass D to higher layer
        			RN = RN + 1
        			Deliver data m to client
        			Send (ACK, RN)
        ```

  - Correct Code for Stop and Wait

    - Sender code:

      - ```pseudocode
        Sender keeps state variable SN, initially 0, and repeats the following loop
        
        Loop forever:
        	Accept a new packet from higher layer and store it in buffer B
        	Transmit a frame (SN, B)
        	If (ACK, R) frame received and R != SN, then
          	SN = R
        		Go to beginning of loop
        	Else if the previous condition does not occur after T sec
        		Re-transmit
        ```

    - Receiver code:

      - ```pseudocode
        Receiver keeps state variable RN, initially 0
        
        When an error-free data frame (S, D) is received:
        	On receipt:
        		If S = RN then:
        			Pass D to higher layer
        			RN = RN + 1
        			Deliver data m to client
        		Send (ACK, RN) // Ack needs to be unconditional
        ```

  - Correctness Observations

    - When sender first gets to `N`, no frames with `N` or `ack`s with `N + 1` and receiver is at `N`
    - When receiver first receives frame `N`, entire system only contains number `N` => only two numbers in system

  - Band Invariant

    - Two bands of equal values `y = x` or `x = y + 1`
    - Prove invariant by checking a small number of state transitions
      - 6 cases: retransmission, error, reception, receive `ack`, send `ack`, and send new frame
      - Just need to show that invariant is preserved by these 6 protocol actions/state transitions



## Lecture 8: Performance Measures and Sliding Window Protocols

- Error Recovery

  - State View
    - States of sender, receiver, and links at various points in the space-time diagram
  -  So far, we've shown:
    - Correctness: based on band invariant
    - Sequence number: one bit suffices
    - Performance: send only one at a time
      - Bad over satellites or any link where the bandwidth-delay product is large
    - Initialization: coming up after performance

- General Performance Measures

  - Throughput: jobs completed per second
    - System owners want to maximize this
  - Latency: worst-case time to complete a job
    - System owners want to minimize this

- Network Specific Measures

  - 1-way propagation delay: time for transmitted bit to reach receiver
    - Contrast to transmission rate (rate at which sender is sending)
  - Pipe size: `Transmission Time * Round-Trip Propagation Delay`
    - Need to pipeline if pipe size is large
    - Sometimes called the bandwidth-delay product

- Sliding Window Protocols

  - Needed to use more of a link's capacity when its pipe size is large

  - Definitions

    - Window: sender can send a *window* of outstanding frames before getting any `ack`s
      - Lower window edge `L` can send up to `L + w - 1`
    - Receiver numbers: receiver has a received sequence number `R`, which is the next number it expects
      - `L` and `R` are initially `0`
    - Sender code: retransmits all frames in current window until it gets an `ack`
      - `ack` numbered `r` implicitly acknowledges all numbers `< r`
    - Two variants: receiver accepts frames in order only (go-back-`N`) or buffers out-of-order frames (selective reject)
      - Selective reject sends back an `ack` with a list of out-of-order packets

  - Code

    - Go-Back-`N`

      - Sender code:

        - ```
          Sender keeps state variable L, initially 0
          
          Send (s, m) // Send data message m with number s
          	The sender can send this frame if:
          		m corresponds to s-th data item given to sender by client AND
          		L â‰¤ s â‰¤ L + w - 1 // In allowed send window
          		
          Receive (r, Ack) // receive an ack number r
          	On receipt:
          		L := r // Slide lower window edge to ack number
          ```

      - Receiver code:

        - ```
          Receiver keeps state variable R, initially 0
          
          Receive (s, m) // Receive data message m with number s
          	On receipt:
          		If s = R then:
          			R := s + 1
          			Deliver data m to client
          
          Send (r, Ack) // Send ack with number r
          	// Receivers typically send acks in response to data
          	// 	messages, but our code can send acks anytime
          	r must equal R
          ```

    - Selective Reject

      - Sender code:

        - ```
          Sender keeps a lower window edge L initially 0 but also an array  with a bit set for all numbers acked so far. Initially, all bits are clear. In practice, we implement this array by a bitmap of size w which we shift.
          
          Send (s, m) // Send data message m with number s
          	The sender can send this frame if:
          		m corresponds to s-th data item given to sender by client AND
          		L â‰¤ s â‰¤ L + w - 1 AND
          		s has not been acked // New for selective reject
          		
          Receive (r, List Ack) // Receive an ack number r with List of 														//		received numbers > r
          	On receipt:
          		L := r // slide lower window edge to ack number, mark numbers
          						// in List as acked at sender
          ```

      - Receiver code:

        - ```
          Receiver keeps a receiver number R initially 0, but also an array with a bit set for all numbers received so far. Initially all bits are clear. In practice, we implement this array again by a bitmap of size w which we shift. In addition to the bit map, we have a buffer for each number where we can store out of order messages.
          
          Receive (s, m) // Receive data message m with number s
          	On receipt:
          		If s â‰¥ R then:
          			Mark s as acked and buffer m
          			While R acked do:
          				Deliver data message at position R
          				R := R + 1
          				
          Send (r, List Ack) // Send ack with number r and List of received
          										// 		received numbers > r
          	r must equal R
          	List contains received numbers > R
          ```

  - Implementation and Other Details

    - Timers: works regardless of values, but needed for performance
      - So caclulate round-trip delay
      - Need only one timer (for lowest outstanding number) in go-back-`n`
      - Need one for each window element in selective reject
    - In selective reject, have to send an `ack` with `R` and a bitmap of numbers greater than `R` that have been received
    - Piggybacking: to reduce frames sent

  - How Big Should the Sequence Number Space Be?

    - Alternating bit: modulus is 2 (just one bit)
    - Go back `w`: need a modulus of `w + 1`
    - Selective reject: need a modulus of `2w`

  - Flow Control

    - Windows provide static flow control
      - Can provide dynamic flow control if receiver `ack`s indicate what receiver will buffer
    - Flow control without error recovery
      - Credits
      - Rate control (sender does not send > `R` frames/sec)

- Initializing Link Protocols

  - Naive Restarts
    - Send a restart message => wait for `ack` to initialize sender and receiver
    - Can be fooled by prior restarts
  - How to design a reliable initialization protocol
    - Non memory after crash: can do correctly if sender keeps even one bit that can survive a crash
    - Determinism: can send restart messages with random numbers and only send data when numbers are `ack`ed
      - High probability only
    - Message lifetimes: if no message can live on a link for more than `T` seconds, simply wait `T` seconds after a crash for all old messages to die out



## Lecture 9: Local Area Networks and Ethernet

- Big Transition in this Class

  - From 1 sender, 1 receiver to many senders, many receivers
  - New problem: how to share a link (MAC)
  - Inherently sequential
  - Link shared among multiple senders, also known as:
    - Multiaccess links: there are multiple nodes that may simultaneously access the link
    - Broadcast links: every transmission  can be heard by all other stations
    - Local area networks (LANs): the geographical area serviced by a LAN is local and small
      - Typically 1-10km

- Why LANs

  - Cost: connect up all computers in a local area, saves wiring costs to share one wire
  - Bandwidth: provides high bandwidth and low error rates for local group of users
    - Worth it because most high-bandwidth distributed computing has access locality

  - Statistical multiplexing: time division multiplexing is not a good idea when user traffic is as bursty as data is, as fixed bandwidths are wasteful
    - Bursty = high peak/average ratio
    - Each user gets access to entire LAN bandwidth when other users are idle
    - As more users are added, they share the bandwidth
    - Better throughput and latency in the average case => what Ethernet does

- Statistical vs. Strict Multiplexing

  - Strict multiplexing: TDM or FDM where a user is given a fixed allocation regardless of whether the user has data to send or not
  - Bursty: traffic has a high peak/average ratio
  - Analysis: gives each user `B/N`, where `N` is the number of possible sources
    - Statistical multiplexing attempts to give each user `B/x`, where `x` is the number of busy users
    - `N` is large (100-1000), while `x` is small (1-10)

  - Example:
    - Suppose 100 users each transfer a 125KB file every 2 hours
    - At 10Mbps, a 125KB file takes 0.1 seconds to transmit (statistical multiplexing)
    - At 0.1 Mbps, file takes 10 seconds to transfer (strict multiplexing)

- Aloha

  - Ethernet predecessor: multiple ground stations in various parts of Hawaii
  - Problem: couldn't detect collisions or sense when channel was busy, similar problems in 802.11
  - Slotted Aloha: reduces vulnerable period by half, but requires a common clock

- In-Transmission Collision Detection and Semi-Reliability

  - Metcalfe knew about Aloha and new he could do better because of the smaller distance
  - 1500B frame involved in a collision
    - Ethernet aborts transmission after 64B
    - Aloha will send the entire 1500B and detect the collision when `ack` is not received
    - Better for large frames and large frame sizes improve efficiency

  - No recovery from frame corruption (1 in a million)
    - However, collisions are infrequent
    - Semi-reliable: detect collisions and retransmit in hardware

- What is a Collision?

  - The notion of a collision is nuanced

  - Definition: a station `A` detects a collision if two or more signals from different senders coexist at `A`

  - Like relativity: different stations detect collisions at different times

    - Worse, without care, some stations may detect collisions and some may not

  - Need mechanisms: want to convert relativity to universality, so that if receiver detects a collision, so does the sender, so sender can retransmit

    - One big mechanism is forcing a minimum packet size
    - If a long enough packet is sent, then the sender can detect the collision, causing a retransmission

  - Waves, not balls: on Ethernet and 802.11, frames are sent as waves that pass through each other and don't collide and rebound like balls

  - Answers:

    - The min packet size is the pipe size

      - $$
        \text{Round trip delay}\times\text{Transmission speed}
        $$

    - Ethernet does binary exponential backoff

      - After attempt `I`, each station randomly picks a random number of slots between `0` and `2^I - 1`
      - A slot is 51.2 Âµsec

    - Both ideas are now classic

- Ethernet

  - Three main mechanisms:
    - Carrier sense and deference: no point transmitting when someone else is speaking
    - Collision detection: stop frame (< 1500B) when before 64B, you detect a collision
    - Exponential backoff: collisions very frequent, so must retransmit
      - Random backoff avoids synchronized collisions
      - Dynamically adjust to number of colliders

  - Smaller mechanisms to make main ideas work:
    - Slot time = `2T`, where `T` is 1-way propagation delay limited to 51.2 Âµsec = 64 bit times at 10Mbps: maximum delay to detect a collision
    - Minimum packet size: 64B to avoid finishing transmission before collision is detected
      - Pad if needed

    - Jam: transmit small number of bits after you detect a collision to ensure that other transmitters also detect collision
    - Collision detection: one way is to use Manchester with average DC level per bit
      - Collision detection by detecting increased voltage level
      - Better ways today

  - Implementation Details
    - Limited distance (2.5km)
      - 500m wires, 4 repeaters

    - Thin wire, thick wire
    - Repeaters/hubs: important device, reads in a bit and writes out a bit on other side, boosting signal strength
    - Physical topology is a star or trees
