Lab 2.1
1. 2^(3^4) --> (expt 2 (expt 3 4)) = 2417851639229258349412352
	(< (expt 3 4) 63) --> yields nil

2. C-h k --> describe-key
   M-SPC --> just-one-space

3. C-h k C-h k gives a more in-depth view of the command represented by C-h k, since it calls describe-key on C-h k

4. M-SPC gives a more in-depth view of the command represented by M-SPC for the same reason listed above

5. M-SPC is implemented in terms of cycle-spacing, which cycles between various space formats

Python Scripting
1. The program runs into an out of bounds errors since /dev/null is an empty file and there are no lines for optparse to parse through

2. The program runs into a syntax error when running randline.py in Python3 since the randline.py was written for Python2, which means the file must contain syntax that is now out of date for Python3

3. The program shuf.py runs fine on both Python2 and Python3, telling us that syntax in Python3 is compatible with Python2, but not vice versa
