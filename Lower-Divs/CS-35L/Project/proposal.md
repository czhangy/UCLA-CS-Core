### Description: BruinByte/BruinBite

- We're going to develop a website that functions like Yelp, but exclusive to the UCLA/Westwood area


- We also want it to have dynamic review capabilities so that clients can interact with our database and vice versa

    - Each restaurant will be rated on some predetermined scale on multiple factors such as service, cost, etc., as well as some overall ranking
    - These reviews will not be linked to an account and will instead be posted using an alias chosen by the user


- We will implement rankings for the various restaurants and menu items


- We will include other data about the restaurants, such as Postmates/GrubHub/etc. availability, phone number, address, etc.


- If time permits, we will implement a map that contains the varying restaurants on the site for convenience

### Technologies:
