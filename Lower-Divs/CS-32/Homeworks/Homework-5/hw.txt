5. b) In order for the output to match the required output in part a), the function must be able to output the current state of the path. However, without the second parameter, the function call has no information about any previous recursive calls, and therefore cannot output any part of the path earlier than the subclass is is called on. For example, when printing Bacterium, the function call would have no idea that Bacterium was derived from Actor.
