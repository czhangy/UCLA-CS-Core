The first algorithm checks one pathway at a time because of the way stacks behave. Since the most recent Coord to be pushed is the next Coord checked, the algorithm will continue to follow a single path until it reaches the end or cannot move further. The second algorithm checks multiple paths at the same time. Since the oldest Coord enqueued is the next Coord checked, the algorithm is constantly enqueuing Coords from different paths, slowly moving away from the starting point.
