a. I struggled a lot with the syntax of using C-strings and would often have to go back and correct certain variables. I also made mistakes in my variable naming, as many of them are too similar to each other to tell which variable does what. I also had to restructure the section of my code that kept track of the number of flowers and bees multiple times because of logic errors. Finally, I found issues in figuring out ways to use break and continue in the way that I wanted.

b. initialize global constants

   function prototype

   main function:
   	initialize array variables

	if no words loaded:
		error message

	prompt and store user input
	if number of rounds negative or zero:
		error message
	
	initialize score variables
	for the number of rounds:
		randomize word
		write out round number and length of mystery word
		playOneRound function
		if player got it first try:
			output first try message
		otherwise:
			output n tries message

		if the first round:
			set max and min scores to round score
		otherwise:
			if score higher than max:
				set max to score
			if score less than min:
				set min to score
		add round score to total score
		set precision to 2 decimal points
		print average, minimum, and maximum scores

   playOneRound function:
	if no words or word index out of bounds:
		return failure condition
	initialize variables to 0
	repeatedly:
		initialize boolean variables and flowers and bees
		prompt and store user input for trial word
		if word has invalid length:
			write out the word has invalid length
			restart loop
		for the entire word file:
			if the trial word is found:
				the trial word is valid
				break
		if the trial word is not valid:
			restart loop
		increment the score
		if the trial word is the correct word:
			return the score
		initialize placeholder variable
		for the length of the trial word:
			for the length of the correct word:
				if characters in both words match:
					if they're in the same position:
						increment the number of flowers
					otherwise:
						increment the number of bees
					set characters to blank and exit the loop
		print the number of flowers and bees
	return the score
