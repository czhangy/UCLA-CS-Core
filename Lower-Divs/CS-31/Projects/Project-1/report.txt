Step 5: Using the original.cpp program, I used inputs of 6 for number of people surveyed, 10 for those that supported impeachment, and -20 for those that opposed impeachment. While this did not produce any error messages, the results stated that 166.7% of people supported impeachment, while -333.3% opposed it, both of which are obviously nonsensical results. 

Step 6: Using the logic_error.cpp program, I deleted the “100.0 * “ in lines 24 and 25 of the code. When using the inputs of 10 for number of people surveyed, 5 for those that supported impeachment, and 5 for those that opposed it, the results stated that 0.0% of people supported it and 0.0% of people opposed it. These nonsensical results were due to me removing the point in the code that converted the data type from int to double, resulting in a value of 0.0 being output, rather than 50.0.

Step 7: Using the compile_error.cpp program, I first deleted a semicolon on line 17, causing the program to fail to compile. This caused the compiler to report a message saying "Expected ';' after expression", and only caused an error on that line of code. The next error I introduced involved removing the "int" on line 13, meaning that the variable numberSurveyed is never declared. As a result, the error "Use of undeclared identifier 'numberSurveyed'" appears on line 13. In addition, the same message appears on lines 18, 24, and 25, the other 3 lines where the variable is used.
