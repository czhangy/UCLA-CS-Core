1. I see a tree structure that details the mergepoint and the branches that 
   come into/from it. This, along with author/date of commit information is 
   displayed in the top subwindow. In the bottom left, there is a screen with
   more details about the merge, including parent and child commits, the branch
   the commit is located in, and the author/committer. The bottom right window
   seems to be for comments, although it is empty for this merge.

3. The Savannah clone of Emacs contains only the master branch, while the one
   in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs contains all of the branches explored using gitk
